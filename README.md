# Intelligent Anomaly Detection System for Digital Transaction Behavior Using ML
This system simulates real-time transaction streams and applies a hybrid ML approach to identify suspicious patterns in financial activities.

## 🚀 Project Overview

With the rapid growth of digital payment systems, financial fraud has become a major concern. Traditional rule-based systems are no longer sufficient to detect modern behavioral fraud patterns.

This project implements:

✔ Hybrid Anomaly Detection Model  
✔ Behavioral Transaction Analysis  
✔ Real-Time Transaction Simulation  
✔ Fraud Risk Probability Scoring  
✔ Django-Based Web Dashboard  

## 🎯 Key Features

📊 Real-Time Transaction Stream Simulation  
🧠 Hybrid ML Model (Isolation Forest + Random Forest)  
📈 Fraud Risk Probability Score Output  
🔎 Behavioral Pattern Analysis (Device, Location, Amount, Time)  
🌐 Web Interface using Django  
📉 Performance Evaluation Metrics  

## 🧠 Hybrid Model Architecture

This system combines two machine learning techniques:

### 1️⃣ Isolation Forest
- Detects unusual transaction behavior
- Works effectively on imbalanced datasets
- Generates anomaly score

### 2️⃣ Random Forest Classifier
- Classifies fraud vs legitimate transactions
- Provides fraud probability

### 🔁 Hybrid Workflow

Transaction Input  
→ Data Preprocessing  
→ Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection)  
→ Random Forest (Classification)  
→ Final Fraud Risk Score
